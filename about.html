                    Hi! My name is Elijah Ballard, and I am a senior Computer Science student at the University of Maryland. 
                    I plan to graduate in Spring of 2024.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I started my life in St. Louis, Missouri. Growing up, 
                    I always had an interest in computers and technology. 
                    However, I did not initially pursue this in high school or 
                    during my freshman year of college.
 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I started college at American University in Washington D.C. 
                    as a Political Science major. While computers are a part of my life, 
                    I also have a passion for politics and government. Before college, 
                    I worked for numerous political companies, helped at polls, and 
                    participated in my community. Because of this background, 
                    I thought that pursuing political science would be a good plan. 
                    However, this changed during the second semester of my freshman year.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I was enrolled in a class where we would meet three times a week, 
                    and for one of the days, we would visit different government 
                    locations such as the White House or the Electoral College. 
                    At every visit, there would always be a speaker who talked 
                    about programming skills in the government and how they are important. 
                    I was already thinking about switching to CS, so this made it much easier.
        
                    <br>
                    <br>
                
                    I now attend UMD and am almost done with the program before I
                     enter the real world. During my time here, I have discovered
                      that I have a passion for web development and would like to
                       pursue this in the real world. I plan to create more projects 
                       that show my skill set in the field.
