            Hi! My name is Elijah Ballard and I am a senior Computer Science student
            at the Univeristy of Maryland. I plan to graduate in Spring of 2024.

            I started my life in St. Louis, Missouri. Growing up, I always had an 
            interest for computers and technology. However, I did not initially pursue this
            in high school or my freshman year of college. 

            I started off college at American University in Washington D.C. as a Political
            Science major. While computers are a part of my life, I also have a passion for 
            politics and the government. Before college, I worked for numerous political 
            companies and helped at polls/participated with my community. Because of this background,
            I thought that pursuing political science would be a good plan. However, this changed during 
            the second semester of my freshman year. 

            I was enrolled in this class where we would meet three times in the week and for one of the days,
            we would go to DC and visit different government locations such as the White House or the 
            Electoral College. At every visit, there would always be a speaker
