          Hi! My name is Elijah Ballard, and I am a senior Computer Science student at the University of Maryland. 
          I plan to graduate in Spring of 2024.</p>

          I started my life in St. Louis, Missouri. Growing up, 
          I always had an interest in computers and technology. 
          However, I did not initially pursue this in high school or 
          during my freshman year of college.
          </p>
      
          <br>
          <p class = "lead text-base">
          I started college at American University in Washington D.C. 
          as a Political Science major. While computers are a part of my life, 
          I also have a passion for politics and government. Before college, 
          I worked for numerous political companies, helped at polls, and 
          participated in my community. Because of this background, 
          I thought that pursuing political science would be a good plan. 
          However, this changed during the second semester of my freshman year.

          I was enrolled in a class where we would meet three times a week, 
          and for one of the days, we would visit different government 
          locations such as the White House or the Electoral College. 
          At every visit, there would always be a speaker who talked 
          about programming skills in the government and how they are important. 
          I was already thinking about switching to CS, so this made it much easier.
          </p>
    
          <br>
          <p class = "lead text-base">
          I now attend UMD and am almost done with the program before I
           enter the real world. During my time here, I have discovered
            that I have a passion for web development and would like to
             pursue this in the real world. I plan to create more projects 
             that show my skill set in the field.
